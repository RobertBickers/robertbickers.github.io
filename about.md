Hi, I’m Robert Bickers, a Software Engineer at PitPat. I spend most of my time building web and mobile applications, with a focus on C# development in .NET MAUI. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean and maintainable code, and creating software that makes life easier (and hopefully a bit more enjoyable) for its users.

When I’m not working, I like to explore new technologies, experiment with side projects, and share what I learn along the way. You can check out some of my work and projects on my GitHub.

##### Projects

You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/RobertBickers) with some honourable mentions being:
