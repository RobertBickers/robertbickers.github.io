I'm Robert. A software engineer working in Cambridge.

This is my space on the web for projects I've created, tips and tricks I've picked up over the years, and more generally as a place to share what ever else I'm interested in.

I started my journey into computing at around 13, creating what I can only assume were terribly designed _skins_ for a website called Bebo and selling them online - then stepping quickly into web development where I got hooked on programming and making things appear on a screen.

I graduated in Computer Science at Anglia Ruskin University in 2014 and have been working as a .NET developer ever since, always in diverse domains in what ever technology suited the requirement best at the time.

I'm also one of those productivity nerds who when _not_ working, can be found exploring ways to work more efficiently and with less friction. This led me to the development of a now defunct web-app and research based scheduling algorithm. - more updates on that coming soon
