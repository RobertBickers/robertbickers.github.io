Hi, I‚Äôm Robert Bickers, a Software Engineer at [PitPat üêæ](https://www.pitpat.com/). I spend most of my time building web and mobile applications, with a focus on C# development in .NET MAUI. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean and maintainable code, and creating software that makes life easier (and hopefully a bit more enjoyable) for its users.

When I‚Äôm not working, I like to explore new technologies, experiment with side projects, and share what I learn along the way. You can check out some of my work and projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/RobertBickers).
