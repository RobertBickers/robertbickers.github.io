But that's not to say it's an easy thing to do. Working from home has some great benefits, no commute, more time with family, a bit more sleep, and not forgetting the savings made from not picking up a meal deal 5 days a week becaus you're too lazy to bring dinner with you.. (Or is that just me?)

That said, working from home isn't easy. It requires discipline, hard work, and takes an extra effort to keep in good communication with your collegues. For some this comes naturally, for others; not so much. 

In this post, I'm going to go through some of the ways I've changed my working habits, environment and even my house to keep working at my best.
